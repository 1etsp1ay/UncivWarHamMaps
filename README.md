# Fun scenarios for UncivWarhammer mod

Map deisgn philosophy is _factual, fair and fun_ where try to adher to [cannon]() (taking artistic liberties with geographies and transdimentional portal of heros) and lotsa easter eggs (not in civipedia).

## Gamemodes

1. solo tutorial - learn the basics of chaos, spells and runecrafting
2. _tba_ deathmatch (1v1) where I try to balance 2 races ... there is a **beta** version for dwarfs vs chaotic cuzs
3. _tbd_ king of the hill (1 vs 3..7) sparse continents with a magic rich hub
4. _tbd_ ultima Y (single city quest board) multiplayer with each civ having their (conflicting) quests in lieu of social policy
5. _tbc_ merchannt of death (battle royale) but the ability to buy runes, spirits and hire mercanries

## Leaderboard

The 1st beta is halfway through a deathmatch but where the dwarfs sign an armistice to crusade against the Tree of Beards. After punishing the greenskins, they are backstabbed by a previous trading ally. There are 3 missions:
1. Mercenary calvary captain invited to defend the outpost and launch a deep raid to punish the perfidious ragheads;
2. Secret cult to formet unrest in the subjugated cities lost by the frog-eaters;
3. Seige expert invited to build a star fortress to defend against the deprevations of the pointy-ears.

You will be rated after exactly 50 turns on the 
- nnumber of wonders built (more == better productive planning)
- less the number of units above 3 for each class (otherwise just spam bombers)
- plus some penalties for losing say an Infernal Swordsland or Halfling Ranger (needed in next scene)

## Beta Testing

This is early testing so take it as _as is, what is_. Discussions on discord. Some FAQ

- _why are there so few workers?_ As the armistice to launch a joint cruisade, the chaos dwarfs agreed to curtail their ... involuntary labor niservitude (cough) and keeping up the constant offerings to Harush, it meant a new deal with TheMoot to invest in foreign "guest workers" fleeing from the Loren invasion
- _so why are the peaceful elves seizing the knight's lands?_ Actually we think because of the successful defence of TheMoot (whom the chaos dwarfs pledged to protect) they looked for weaker prey. We chaotic dwarfs are in search of truth so the spurious accusations of spying, assassination and kidnapping of spellsingers is utterly without evidence (and we made damn sure of it);
- _what are you doing so far away from your capital?_ Crusade. Gross species insult. Book of Grudges. We had a peaceful trade then those treacherous ragheads stabbed us in the back by declaring jihad. Just we prefer rational unbiased experientation (in vivos experimentation works best) and not pandering to pagan superstitions is no reason to refuse to sit down to discuss peace (once we prepare a nicely sharpened stake).
