# Fun scenarios for UncivWarhammer mod

Map deisgn philosophy is _factual, fair and fun_ where try to adher to [cannon]() (taking artistic liberties with geographies and transdimentional portal of heros) and lotsa easter eggs (not in civipedia).

## Gamemodes

1. solo tutorial - learn the basics of chaos, spells and runecrafting
2. _tba_ deathmatch (1v1) where I try to balance 2 races ... there is a **beta** version for dwarfs vs chaotic cuzs
3. _tbd_ king of the hill (1 vs 3..7) sparse continents with a magic rich hub
4. _tbd_ ultima Y (single city quest board) multiplayer with each civ having their (conflicting) quests in lieu of social policy
5. _tbc_ merchannt of death (battle royale) but the ability to buy runes, spirits and hire mercanries

## Leaderboard

The 1st beta is halfway through a deathmatch but where the dwarfs sign an armistice to crusade against the Tree of Beards. After punishing the greenskins, they are backstabbed by a previous trading ally. There are 3 missions:
1. Mercenary calvary captain invited to defend the outpost and launch a deep raid to punish the perfidious ragheads;
2. Secret cult to formet unrest in the subjugated cities lost by the frog-eaters;
3. Seige expert invited to build a star fortress to defend against the deprevations of the pointy-ears.

You will be rated after exactly 50 turns on the 
- nnumber of wonders built (more == better productive planning)
- less the number of units above 3 for each class (otherwise just spam bombers)
- plus some penalties for losing say an Infernal Swordsland or Halfling Ranger (needed in next scene)
