I'd note that the Unciv influence tilemap is _purely symbolic_ and does not represent the actual territory as it includes just the major participants mentioned in this minor chapter of the [Dammaz Kron](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Great_Book_of_Grudges).

# Borgio Book of Battles (my own ineptitude)

## Mousillion Massacre

> A cold day south of the Empire, a wide plain bare of trees and hills. Behind me, an aged [DaemonSmith](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Chaos_Dwarfs) girdded in by his (or her?) golem bodyguards, and the liberated Castle Breston. The [Fay Folk](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Athel_Loren) claims it was snatched by treachery and terror, yet they ignore the decades of oppressive pacification program in the Mootlands. Many of my halfling friends and dear colleagues would lose their appetite (a most serious matter for the [pie-loving](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Pie_Week) rascals) at their uncaring eviction to reforest the rich farmlands. I was sorely troubled since with during my years of care and craft, I had _something_ to work with, water to form dykes or cunning alchemical recipes to brew hellfire, or the land itself to shape to my imagination of interlocking fortificaitons. Yet there was no time as before my eyes was troops of calvery and peasant levies as far as the eye could see. All with their very sharp _pointy_ lances aiming at my sinkng stomach. Behind, the DaemonSmith was chanting, his last prayers to Hashut I suspect. I care not for the color of their coin nor that taint of warp in runecrafting, but that they were the only ones that promised to liberate my homeland from the invaders. That faint, nay foolish but heartfelt dream would end today ...

## Assault on Araby

> My most esteemd battle companion
> 
> I am greatly saddened by the loss of many colleagues from Grail Knighthood, but relieved at your safe delivery from a most fearsome charge. Though I cannot understand how so many golems could spring out of the ground, it is the sheer stupidity of the lackluster lords of the realm who cannot fanthom the age of sword and sorcery has passed? Despite the vows of silence binding up to our `employees`, surely reports should have filtered back of their mastery of fire and water to cast great engines of destruction. What has been so surprising is the air-bourne version is any less unanticipated. When we next meet over our favorite wines, I shall regale you of my daring desert dash. I can't ssy more but when those inferenal swordsman let loose their steeds to facilitate this deep raid, I could never imagine we'd sight the walls of the capital without benig chained up as prisoner after running the gauntlet of fireships and constant patrols of flyng carpets.. Great deed make Great men but even I fear the tales that will emerge.
