# Borgio Book of Battles (my own ineptitude)

## Mousillion Massacre

> A cold day south of Bretonia, a wide plain bare of trees and hills. Behind me, an aged Smith walled in by his (or her?) golem bodyguards, and the liberated city of Breston. The Loren claimed it was snatched by treachery and terror yet they ignore the decades of pacification program in The Moot. Many of my halfling friends and dear colleagues would lose their appetite (a most serious matter for the [pie-loving](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Pie_Week) rascals) at their uncaring eviction to reforest the rich farmlands. I was sorely troubled since with all my years of care and craft, I had _something_ to work with, water to form dykes or cunning alchemical recipes to brew fire, or the land itself to shape to my imagination of interlocking fortificaitons. Yet there was no time as before my eyes was troops of calvery and peasant levies as far as the eye could see. All with their very sharp _pointy_ lances aiming at my sinkng stomach. Behind, the smith was chanting, his last prayers to Hashut I suspect. I care not for the color of their coin nor that taint of warp in runecrafting, but that they were the only ones that promised to liberate my homeland from the invaders. That foolish but heartfelt dream would end today ...
